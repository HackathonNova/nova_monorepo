Ammonia Reactor Fundamentals

Process overview
- Reaction: N2 + 3H2 ⇌ 2NH3 (exothermic, equilibrium-limited)
- Typical converter conditions: 150–250 bar, 400–500°C
- Catalysts: promoted iron (industrial standard) or ruthenium (high-activity, lower pressure)

Feed preparation
- Remove CO, CO2, H2O, sulfur, and chlorides to avoid catalyst poisoning
- Maintain H2:N2 ratio near 3:1 with slight H2 excess
- Compress and preheat feed using heat recovered from reactor effluent

Reactor and loop behavior
- Multi-bed converter with inter-stage cooling to manage equilibrium and hot spots
- Heat integration drives steam generation and preheats incoming synthesis gas
- Ammonia is condensed from cooled effluent; unreacted gases are recycled
- A purge stream prevents inert accumulation (argon, methane)

Control priorities
- Converter inlet temperature and bed temperature profile
- Loop pressure and recycle ratio
- H2/N2 ratio stability and purge rate
- Cooling duty and condenser performance

Safety and reliability
- High-pressure integrity, leak detection, and relief systems
- Ammonia toxicity exposure controls and ventilation
- Rapid isolation or quench on temperature runaway or loss of circulation
