Futuristic Factory Digital Twin Dashboard

Project Overview

This project is a modern React-based web application showcasing a futuristic factory dashboard with interactive digital twins.
It highlights three main systems within the factory:

Reactor System – monitor temperature, pressure, and AI alerts.

Pipes Network – visualize fluid flow, maintenance stats, and potential issues.

Storage System – track inventory levels, AI optimization suggestions, and alerts.

The landing page presents the project in a sleek, high-tech style with responsive design, feature highlights, and a call-to-action to explore the dashboard. The dashboard contains placeholders for 3D models and AI-driven interactions for future integration.
